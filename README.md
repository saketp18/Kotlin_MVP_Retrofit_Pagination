# Kotlin_MVP_Retrofit_Pagination

This repo is to demonstrate use of Kotlin with Retrofit and using MVP architectural design pattern.
This project is built on pure kotlin language to seek understanding of Kotlin and develop and demostrate use of it. Retrofit is used with architectural design pattern as MVP and JSON request is taken from https://newsapi.org which displays news based on query. As in this project I have placed query as 'india'. Hope this helps you.
